Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a dedicated Node.js Backend Engineer with expertise in building robust and scalable web applications. I'm passionate about crafting efficient and maintainable code using modern development practices. Here's an overview of my skillset:

## Skills

### Node.js

I'm proficient in Node.js, using its asynchronous, event-driven architecture to develop fast and scalable applications. My experience includes API creation, request handling, and server-side logic management.

### MongoDB

With MongoDB, I handle both structured and unstructured data. I design database schemas, perform CRUD operations, and optimize queries for optimal performance. Seamless integration with Node.js is a key focus.

### Redis

Redis is my preferred caching and in-memory data store solution. It enhances application speed and responsiveness by storing frequently accessed data. I implement features like session management, rate limiting, and real-time data processing.

### RabbitMQ

RabbitMQ is my choice for implementing messaging patterns in distributed systems. It enables asynchronous communication between microservices, enhancing scalability and fault tolerance.

### Microservices
Microservices architecture is my approach to building complex applications, improving scalability, maintainability, and fault isolation. I can design, develop, and deploy microservices using various tools and technologies.

### Nest.js

I prefer Nest.js for building efficient and modular Node.js applications. Its dependency injection, module system, and decorators streamline development. I use Nest.js to structure applications, manage routes, and handle middleware.
